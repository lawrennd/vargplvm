  # % WHITEKERNGRADIENT Gradient of white-noise (WHITE) kernel's

  # % FORMAT:
  # %
  # % DESC computes the gradient of functions with respect to the
  # % white noise kernel's parameters. As well as the kernel structure
  # % and the input positions, the user provides a matrix PARTIAL which
  # % gives the partial derivatives of the function with respect to the
  # % relevant elements of the kernel matrix. 
  # %
  # % ARG kern : the kernel structure for which the gradients are being
  # % computed.
  # %
  # % ARG x : the input locations for which the gradients are being
  # % computed. 
  # %
  # % ARG partial (only element of varargin): matrix of partial
  # % derivatives of the function of interest with respect to the
  # % kernel matrix. The argument takes the form of a square matrix of
  # % dimension  numData, where numData is the number of rows in X.
  # %
  # % RETURN g : gradients of the function of interest with respect to
  # % the kernel parameters. The ordering of the vector should match
  # % that provided by the function kernExtractParam.
  # %
  # % ALTERNATIVE FORMAT:
  #   %
  # % DESC computes the derivatives as above, but input locations are
  # % now provided in two matrices associated with rows and columns of
  # % the kernel matrix. 
  # %
  # % ARG kern : the kernel structure for which the gradients are being
  # % computed.
  # %
  # % ARG x1 : the input locations associated with the rows of the
  # % kernel matrix.
  # %
  # % ARG x2 (first element of varargin): the input locations
  # % associated with the columns of the kernel matrix.
  # %
  # % ARG partial (second element of varargin): matrix of partial
  # % derivatives of the function of interest with respect to the
  # % kernel matrix. The matrix should have the same number of rows as
  # % X1 and the same number of columns as X2 has rows.
  # %
  # % RETURN g : gradients of the function of interest with respect to
  # % the kernel parameters.
