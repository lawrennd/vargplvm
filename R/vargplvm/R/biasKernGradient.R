# % DESC computes the gradient of functions with respect to the
# % bias
# % kernel's parameters. As well as the kernel structure and the
# % input positions, the user provides a matrix PARTIAL which gives
# % the partial derivatives of the function with respect to the
# % relevant elements of the kernel matrix. 
# % ARG kern : the kernel structure for which the gradients are being
# % computed.
# % ARG x : the input locations for which the gradients are being
# % computed. 
# % ARG partial : matrix of partial derivatives of the function of
# % interest with respect to the kernel matrix. The argument takes
# % the form of a square matrix of dimension  numData, where numData is
# % the number of rows in X.
# % RETURN g : gradients of the function of interest with respect to
# % the kernel parameters. The ordering of the vector should match
# % that provided by the function kernExtractParam.
# %
# % FORMAT
# % DESC computes the derivatives as above, but input locations are
# % now provided in two matrices associated with rows and columns of
# % the kernel matrix. 
# % ARG kern : the kernel structure for which the gradients are being
# % computed.
# % ARG x1 : the input locations associated with the rows of the
# % kernel matrix.
# % ARG x2 : the input locations associated with the columns of the
# % kernel matrix.
# % ARG partial : matrix of partial derivatives of the function of
# % interest with respect to the kernel matrix. The matrix should
# % have the same number of rows as X1 and the same number of columns
# % as X2 has rows.
# % RETURN g : gradients of the function of interest with respect to
# % the kernel parameters.
