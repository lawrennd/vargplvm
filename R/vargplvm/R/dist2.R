# %DIST2	Calculates squared distance between two sets of points.
# %
# %	Description
# %	D = DIST2(X, C) takes two matrices of vectors and calculates the
# %	squared Euclidean distance between them.  Both matrices must be of
# %	the same column dimension.  If X has M rows and N columns, and C has
# %	L rows and N columns, then the result has M rows and L columns.  The
# %	I, Jth entry is the  squared distance from the Ith row of X to the
# %	Jth row of C.
