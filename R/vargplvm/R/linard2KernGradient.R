  # % LINARD2KERNGRADIENT Gradient of LINARD2 kernel's parameters.

  # % DESC computes the gradient of functions with respect to the
  # % automatic relevance determination linear
  # % kernel's parameters. As well as the kernel structure and the
  # % input positions, the user provides a matrix PARTIAL which gives
  # % the partial derivatives of the function with respect to the
  # % relevant elements of the kernel matrix. 
  # % ARG kern : the kernel structure for which the gradients are being
  # % computed.
  # % ARG x : the input locations for which the gradients are being
  # % computed. 
  # % ARG partial : matrix of partial derivatives of the function of
  # % interest with respect to the kernel matrix. The argument takes
  # % the form of a square matrix of dimension  numData, where numData is
  # % the number of rows in X.
  # % RETURN g : gradients of the function of interest with respect to
  # % the kernel parameters. The ordering of the vector should match
  # % that provided by the function kernExtractParam.
  # %
  # % FORMAT
  # % DESC computes the derivatives as above, but input locations are
  # % now provided in two matrices associated with rows and columns of
  # % the kernel matrix. 
  # % ARG kern : the kernel structure for which the gradients are being
  # % computed.
  # % ARG x1 : the input locations associated with the rows of the
  # % kernel matrix.
  # % ARG x2 : the input locations associated with the columns of the
  # % kernel matrix.
  # % ARG partial : matrix of partial derivatives of the function of
  # % interest with respect to the kernel matrix. The matrix should
  # % have the same number of rows as X1 and the same number of columns
  # % as X2 has rows.
  # % RETURN g : gradients of the function of interest with respect to
  # % the kernel parameters.
