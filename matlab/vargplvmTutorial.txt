% Setting the path
The dependencies are listed in the release webpage.
Additionally, you should include in the path ./data and ./utilities, if you
intend to use them. 

% Loading the data
The provided demos are often required to load very large files that cannot
be stored on SVN, and thus, they cannot be loaded in the standard way using
lvmLoadData (which reads the data from the DATASETS directory).
For this reason, we have a "vargplvmLoadLocalData.m" function which looks
into two directories which should be both added to the path: the first one,
must also contain the file "localDatasetsDirectorySmall.m", and is
typically used for small datasets (e.g. that can be synced via dropbox etc).
Similarly, the second directory should contain the file
"localDatasetsDirectoryLarge.m". Everything else becomes just automatic, in
the sense that the function that you only need to call 
"vargplvmLoadLocalData.m" will check both of the aforementioned local dirs
and if it fails, it calls lvmLoadData as usual.


% The model structure



% Parallelism
Paralellism can be achieved in two levels: with respect to models, and with
respect to N in each model (this is done in the rbfard2VardistPsi2Compute
and rbfard2VardistPsi2Gradients). 

We should perform some benchmarks and see which are the optimal settings,
but one would expect that it is not optimal to use both ways to parallelize
the program. 
A reasonable idea is to use the model-wise parallelism when we have a large
number of models (e.g. close to the number of cores/workers to be used),
otherwise (and if N is relatively big) we can use the point-wise paral
